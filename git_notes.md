  # GIT INTRODUCTION
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in files and folders in a project over time. It allows multiple 
 developers to work on the same project simultaneously without interfering with each other's progress. Git is known for its efficiency, 
 flexibility, and robust support for branching and merging.
